ASSIGNMENT 3:
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Scenario: Emergency Relief Supply Distribution
A devastating flood has hit multiple villages in a remote area, and the government, along
with NGOs, is organizing an emergency relief operation. A rescue team has a limited-capacity
boat that can carry a maximum weight of W kilograms. The boat must transport
critical supplies, including food, medicine, and drinking water, from a relief center to the
affected villages.
Each type of relief item has:
● A weight (wi) in kilograms.
● Utility value (vi) indicating its importance (e.g., medicine has higher value than food).
● Some items can be divided into smaller portions (e.g., food and water), while others must
be taken as a whole (e.g., medical kits).
As the logistics manager, you must:
1. Implement the Fractional Knapsack algorithm to maximize the total utility value of the
supplies transported.
2. Prioritize high-value items while considering weight constraints.
3. Allow partial selection of divisible items (e.g., carrying a fraction of food packets).
4. Ensure that the boat carries the most critical supplies given its weight limit W.
